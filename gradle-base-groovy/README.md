# Gradle base configuration (with Groovy buildscripts)

There is already a Gradle base configuration but after fooling around with Kotlin buildscripts for Gradle it seems they aren't quite mature enough for my liking. There's enough weirdness with the `buildSrc` and enough documentation from other places still only having the Groovy that I think this is useful.
